# 🚁 ESP32 Weather Drone - Project Progress Documentation

**Project Start Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Last Updated:** August 18, 2025 – LATENCY, HIGH-PRECISION GPS, IMU ROTATION, PID ENHANCEMENTS  
**Current Phase:** 🧪 CONTROL QUALITY & STABILIZATION IMPROVEMENT (Development Branch)

---

## 🆕 AUG 18, 2025 – RECENT DEVELOPMENT UPDATES

### ✅ Radio Control Latency Reduced

- Radio task poll interval tightened to ~2ms (≈500Hz) enabling near-real-time reception.
- NRF24 data rate raised to 1 Mbps; auto-retry counts trimmed → lower control-to-actuator lag.
- Removed superfluous loop delays in RF code path.

### ✅ High-Precision GPS Telemetry (Development Only)

- Replaced int16 lat/lon (*100) with int32 latitudeE7 / longitudeE7 (*1e7) → ~1 cm resolution.
- Firebase & serial output updated (development remote). Stable firmware intentionally unchanged for compatibility.

### ✅ IMU 90° CW Rotation Compensation

- Applied axis remap: bodyX=sensorY, bodyY=-sensorX, bodyZ=sensorZ; rollRate=gyroY, pitchRate=-gyroX, yawRate=gyroZ.
- Transformed stored calibration (gyro & accel) into body frame before subtraction.
- Fixed earlier drift caused by incorrect gyro bias association.

### ✅ Attitude Fusion Integrity

- Complementary filter (α=0.98) remains default; optional 1D Kalman preserved (disabled).
- Ensured calibration edge reseeds angle state; eliminated double-offset subtraction.

### ✅ PID Controller Enhancements

- Integral gating by throttle (>35%) while keeping P/D active at low throttle.
- Integral leak (iTermLeak) to decay bias when integral accumulation paused.
- Yaw feed-forward term (0.10–0.15) improves yaw responsiveness without excess P.
- Optional cascaded Angle→Rate architecture (roll/pitch) added; disabled by default.
- Consistent output limits (±400 roll/pitch, ±200 yaw) across RF & WiFi builds.

### ✅ Unified Scaled Motor Mixer Consistency

- Same dynamic dual-sided scaling algorithm in both builds; verified matching outputs under identical gains.
- Full throttle span preserved; mixer auto-scales differential axes only near saturation.

### ✅ Logging & Perceived Lag Clarified

- Slow angle updates in status task due to 0.1 Hz diagnostic print, not control loop latency (IMU 100Hz, PID 50Hz, radio poll 500Hz).

### 🔍 Verified Data Path

- Code search confirmed `imuData.roll/pitch` (post-rotation & bias correction) feed PID inputs directly; no legacy pre-rotation usage remains.

### 📌 Pending / Optional Next Steps

- Add telemetry schema version byte (dev vs stable discrimination).
- Higher-rate (25–50Hz) lightweight debug streaming toggle.
- Yaw absolute heading (magnetometer or enhanced gyro drift management).
- Automated post-rotation calibration validation routine.

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions

1. **ESP32Servo over LEDC** - Better ESC compatibility
2. **POST over GET** - More reliable motor control
3. **Dual Altitude Sources** - GPS + Barometric for redundancy
4. **FreeRTOS Tasks** - Better real-time performance
5. **Web Dashboard First** - Easier debugging and tuning
6. **PID Library Choice** - br3ttb/PID for Arduino compatibility
7. **Complementary Filter** - Simple and effective sensor fusion
8. **X-Configuration Mixing** - Standard quadcopter motor layout

### Flight Controller Architecture

**Task Distribution:**

- **Control Task (100Hz, Core 1)**: PID calculations, motor mixing, safety checks
- **Sensor Task (200Hz, Core 0)**: IMU reading, orientation calculation, sensor fusion
- **Telemetry Task (10Hz, Core 0)**: Web server, data logging, status reporting

**Safety Features:**

- Command timeout detection (2 second limit)
- Battery voltage monitoring (emergency at <10%)
- Sensor health monitoring (100ms timeout limit)
- Excessive tilt protection (±60° limit)
- Gradual emergency landing procedure
- Multiple arming safety checks

**Flight Modes:**

- **DISARMED**: All motors at minimum, no control active
- **MANUAL**: Direct throttle control, no stabilization
- **STABILIZE**: Angle-based stabilization with PID control
- **ALTITUDE_HOLD**: Maintains current altitude using barometric/GPS sensor
- **EMERGENCY**: Automatic gradual landing with visual/audio alerts

### Lessons Learned

1. ESP32 WebServer dynamic routing has limitations
2. Request throttling essential for slider controls
3. JSON buffer sizing critical for complex data
4. Visual feedback improves user experience
5. Battery monitoring crucial for flight safety
